            Calculating the entire global footprint of space science.
            the scientists suggests the footprint of space science adds
            up to 1.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide released into
            the atmosphere each year, and it has a lifetime footprint of
            20.3 million metric tons. The work by the researchers involved
            obtaining and scouring prior astronomy research papers that
            included descriptions of the amount of energy used during 46

            expanded their effort to make estimations, using data from their
